/*
 * 2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-confusion-of-an-exam/
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A teacher is writing a test with n true/false questions, with 'T'
 * denoting true and 'F' denoting false. He wants to confuse the students
 * by maximizing the number of consecutive questions with the same answer
 * (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).
 *
 * You are given a string answerKey, where answerKey[i] is the original
 * answer to the i^th question. In addition, you are given an integer k,
 * the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:
 *
 * • Change the answer key for any question to 'T' or 'F' (i.e., set
 * answerKey[i] to 'T' or 'F').
 *
 * Return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer
 * key after performing the operation at most k times.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey
 * = "TTTT".
 * There are four consecutive 'T's.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make
 * answerKey = "FFFT".
 * Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make
 * answerKey = "TFFF".
 * In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey =
 * "TTTTTFTT"
 * Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey =
 * "TTFTTTTT".
 * In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	• n == answerKey.length
 *
 * 	• 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 *
 * 	• answerKey[i] is either 'T' or 'F'
 *
 * 	• 1 <= k <= n
